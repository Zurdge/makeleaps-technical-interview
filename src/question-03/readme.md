# Goals

1 - See the images inside the `reference` folder, We've roughly mocked up the component but the styling isn't quite right. Could you make some improvements to get it closer to the reference images.

2 - Change the component so that each time the ApiHook updates it will push a new entry into the array controlling the red & green arrows. There can only be a maximum of 5 arrows visible.
